{"name":"Virtual Desktop","tagline":"A raw but functional virtual desktop","body":"### Project Summary\r\nThis project was motivated by a few simple facts.  1) I have access to, and frequently use, all major operating systems:  Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows. 2) I am tired of the divergent and competing desktop metaphors. 3) Particularly on Windows (which I always seem to use at work), if I connect to a projector, then I run the risk of my desktop size being changed for me and my icons will probably be re-arranged in an order that makes no sense to me (and, often, it will not restore the icon layout when I disconnect).\r\n\r\nTherefore, I thought \"hey... I am a Java developer.  Let me dust off my desktop/Swing skills and I will have a cross-platform, portable desktop!\"  This project is the on-going result of that idea and, despite the fact that Oracle says JavaFX is the future of Java GUIs, this Swing application is shaping up nicely (including the use of SVG icons).\r\n\r\nOne final note:  \"Portable Desktop\" might be a better name for this project as \"Virtual Desktop\" might imply the use of VNC and/or the ability to remotely access the desktop.  I like the name (for now) and have no intent on changing it but thought I would add this clarification for those of you who have read this far.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
