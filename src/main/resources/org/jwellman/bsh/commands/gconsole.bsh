/* === This opens the groovy console ===
   20180819 : I thought this didn't work but it does open the console in an external JFrame.
   I can't remember why I didn't pursue this further... maybe I was obsessed
   with trying to pull it into the desktop.  Or maybe it doesn't work as expected
   when run in the JVD environment... stay tuned.
... Did this console warning come from this?
