/**
 * A beanshell script that initializes my "working session" [1]
 * by calling other scripts, etc.  This is meant to be customizable over time
 * and must be run via the sourceUTF8() custom command[2].
 *
 * [1] "working session" is my terminology... just means that I run this
 *     script on each invocation of the interactive shell so that it has
 *     my custom methods and variables.
 * [2] sourceUTF8() is in the commands folder and therefore is expected
 *     to be loaded via the importCommands() command so make it the first
 *     line in this script.  Also, I have added a default line in the console
 *     history when it is initialized to make this easier (i.e. just hit the up key).
 *     Finally, this script itself will *NOT* be read in UTF8 so avoid the use
 *     of incompatible characters (i.e. see env.bsh for an example)
