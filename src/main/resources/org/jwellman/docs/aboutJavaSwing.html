      <h1>Swing API</h1>

      <p>Swing API is a set of extensible GUI Components
         to ease the developer's life to create JAVA based Front End/GUI Applications. 
         It is build on top of AWT API and acts as a replacement of AWT API; 
         it has almost every control corresponding to AWT controls plus more.
         Swing component follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to
         fulfill the following design goals:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><p>A single API is to be sufficient to support multiple look and feel.</p></li>
         <li><p>API is to be model driven so that the highest level API is not required to have data.</p></li>
         <li><p>API is to use the Java Bean model so that Builder Tools and IDE can provide better services to developers.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>MVC Architecture</h2>
      <p>Swing API architecture follows loosely based MVC architecture in the following manner:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><p>Model represents the component's data.</p></li>
         <li><p>View represents visual representation of the component's data.</p></li>
         <li><p>Controller takes the input from the user (on the view) and reflects those changes in the component's data.</p></li>
         <li><p>Swing component has Model as a separate element, while the 
         View and Controller part are together in the same User Interface element. 
         This design contributes to Swing's pluggable look-and-feel architecture.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Swing Features</h2>
      <ul>
         <li><p><b>Light Weight</b> - Swing components are independent of native Operating System's API as Swing API controls are rendered using pure JAVA code instead of underlying operating system calls.</p></li>
         <li><p><b>Rich Controls</b> - Swing provides a rich set of advanced controls like Tree, TabbedPane, Slider, ColorPicker, and Table.</p></li>
         <li><p><b>Highly Customizable</b> - Swing controls can be customized in a very easy way as visual appearance is independent of internal representation.</p></li>
         <li><p><b>Pluggable Look-and-Feel</b> - SWING based GUI Application look and feel can be changed at run-time, if desired.</p></li>
      </ul>
