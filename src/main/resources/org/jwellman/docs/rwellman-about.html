        /* It does not appear that this title affects anything seen within
           the "help viewer", but does appear as a page header when printed.
           ... wrong... it also appears in the search tab as the name of the
           "page" where it finds results.  To me, this is a bit confusing as
           I would expect the search results to display according to the 
           table of contents but this is just my natural assumption.
           Maybe there's a reason for this that just doesn't click yet.
           Regardless, this seems to be the designed behavior so
           maybe this is a "best practice" to ensure that this title
           attribute matches the table of contents (*-toc.xml)

      <h1>About JPAD</h1>
      <p>JPAD is a Java-Powered Alternative Desktop.  To be clear, it is *not*
      an application that actually replaces your Operating System desktop in *any*
      way.  It is simply an application (written in Java) that you could(should?)
      use instead of your native desktop to accomplish MANY of the same things. 
      </p>
      <p>Why would you want to use an application instead of just using your native desktop?
      Answer:  To put *you* in control of your desktop.
      </p>
      <p>Not all users will agree but I do not always like when my OS manufacturer
      "enhances" the native desktop experience with an upgrade.  From simple things
      like "I don't need/want that feature" all the way to "where the hell did my
      shortcuts go?!".  I am a developer and I get VERY accustomed to my desktop
      experience and rely on it for productivity since I am in front of my computer
      for at least 8 hours a day.  I like having icons for my often used applications
      on my desktop. I like to have them where I put them and I want them to stay there
      (even after an OS upgrade).  While most of this stems from how Microsoft
      has upgraded its desktop over the years and I overwhelmingly use Windows
      both at home and work, another benefit is that I can run this desktop
      environment on both Mac and Linux AND IT STILL RUNS THE SAME!!!!
      My icons are the same, they are in the same location, etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>This vapp can only be opened in an external frame.</p>
      <p>This internal frame is simply a placeholder and
            allows you to close/exit the vapp by clicking
            the button below.
