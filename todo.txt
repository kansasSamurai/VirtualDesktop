there appears to be "newer" JScrollableDesktopPane at https://github.com/hussachai/hswing/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jscroll/JScrollDesktopPane.java
I do not know if it is "better" or even modified from the version that I currently have.
More research required.

todo: JInternalFrame with menu

done: ? - 12/9/2019: create a tree of opened vapps;
      possibly override minimized apps to not display and
      rely on the tree to restore
      Current implementation is a JList

done: integrate desktop icons (from proof of concept)

todo: possibly allow "sub-applications" to contribute to the desktop menubar/menus;
      if so, it might be wise/desirable to decorate either the standard menu items
      or the added menu items so that the user can differentiate which is which.
      12/9/2019: I honestly don't know if I will ever make this a priority;
      it might be neat as a proof of concept but it's not really a priority to me
      
todo: create a class and/or framework jar as demo for how to write a simple app
      i.e. do not extend JFrame 

To write "portable" java apps:
* Do not use a look and feel
* Do not use your own container; i.e. JFrame or JInternalFrame (and JDialog)
* Rather... use JPanel for EVERYTHING (let the framework put your JPanel in the appropriate container)
* Do not call System.exit()!!!
* Do not use modal dialogs directly; use a portable interface.
* If your app is somehow specific to an OS, then
  all such behavior must check for that OS before trying to run.  
  Either throw an exception or call to the abstract dialog interface.
