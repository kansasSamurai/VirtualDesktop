todo: JInternalFrame with menu
tood: create a tree of opened vapps;
      possibly override minimized apps to not display and
      rely on the tree to restore
todo: integrate desktop icons (from proof of concept)
todo: possibly allow "sub-applications" to contribute to the desktop menubar/menus;
      if so, it might be wise/desirable to decorate either the standard menu items
      or the added menu items so that the user can differentiate which is which.
      
todo: create a class and/or framework jar as demo for how to write a simple app
      i.e. do not extend JFrame 
To write "portable" java apps:
* Do not use a look and feel
* Do not use your own container; i.e. JFrame
* Do not call System.exit()!!!
* Do not use modal dialogs directly;
  use a portable interface.
* If your app is somehow specific to an OS, then
  all such behavior must check for that OS before
  trying to run.  Either throw an exception or
  call to the abstract dialog interface.
